# Building Mode

You are implementing tasks from the existing implementation plan.

## Your Task

1. **Read** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
2. **Select** the highest priority incomplete task
3. **Investigate** relevant code (don't assume not implemented)
4. **Implement** the task completely
5. **Validate** with tests and builds
6. **Update** the plan (mark complete, note discoveries)
7. **Commit** changes

## Constraints

- ONE task per iteration
- Must pass all validation before committing
- Update AGENTS.md if you discover operational knowledge
