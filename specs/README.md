# Fresher Specifications

Design documentation for a portable Ralph Loop implementation that enables AI-driven iterative development using Claude Code.

## Overview

Fresher implements the Ralph Loop methodology - an iterative execution model with two modes (PLANNING and BUILDING) that uses fresh context each iteration, enabling specification-driven development with AI assistance.

> **Note:** Fresher was rewritten from Bash to Rust in v2.0.0 for single-binary distribution. Some specs still reference the original Bash architecture and need updating.

**Status Legend:**
- **Planned** - Design complete, not yet implemented
- **In Progress** - Currently being implemented
- **Implemented** - Feature complete (Rust)
- **Needs Update** - Implemented but spec describes old Bash architecture

## Core Components

| Spec | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| [loop-executor.md](./loop-executor.md) | **Needs Update** | Loop execution via `fresher plan` and `fresher build` commands (Rust: commands/plan.rs, build.rs) |
| [prompt-templates.md](./prompt-templates.md) | **Implemented** | PROMPT.md files for PLANNING and BUILDING modes (Rust: templates.rs) |
| [project-scaffold.md](./project-scaffold.md) | **Needs Update** | `fresher init` command with project detection (Rust: commands/init.rs) |

## Verification & Quality

| Spec | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| [plan-verification.md](./plan-verification.md) | **Needs Update** | `fresher verify` command for spec coverage analysis (Rust: verify.rs) |
| [self-testing.md](./self-testing.md) | Planned | Test scenarios to verify the loop works correctly |

## Extensibility

| Spec | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| [lifecycle-hooks.md](./lifecycle-hooks.md) | **Implemented** | Bash hooks with timeout, exit codes, env vars (Rust: hooks.rs) |
| [docker-isolation.md](./docker-isolation.md) | In Progress | Config exists, execution not yet wired up |
| [docker-ux.md](./docker-ux.md) | Planned | Auto-orchestration, streaming output, dependency presets |

## Distribution & Usage

| Spec | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| [installer.md](./installer.md) | **Needs Update** | `fresher upgrade` command for self-update from GitHub (Rust: upgrade.rs) |
| [project-integration.md](./project-integration.md) | **Implemented** | Part of `fresher init` - gitignore, project detection, CLAUDE.md |
| [documentation.md](./documentation.md) | Planned | Comprehensive README with install, modes, hooks, config, troubleshooting |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Fresher (download binary or cargo install)
cargo install fresher
# Or download from GitHub releases

# Initialize Fresher in a project
fresher init

# Run planning mode (creates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
fresher plan

# Run building mode (executes tasks from plan)
fresher build

# Verify spec coverage
fresher verify

# Check for updates
fresher upgrade --check
```

## Design Principles

1. **Fresh Context**: Each iteration starts with cleared context to stay in the "smart zone"
2. **Subagent Delegation**: Main agent coordinates, subagents handle heavy lifting
3. **Backpressure**: Tests and builds provide validation gates
4. **Portability**: `.fresher/` folder can be added to any project
5. **Safety First**: Docker isolation available for dangerous permissions mode
